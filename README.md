# Neutronia

This mod is made to extend the amount of blocks, structures, entities, biomes and more for all of the dimensions in minecraft.

We that work on Neutronia tries to make all of it's textures as close to vanilla as we can without copying vanilla. We are right now trying to fit with the "new" default textures.

Neutronia is made out of different modules and those modules are:

* Neutronia: Overworld Expansion
    * Neutronia: OE-General
    * Neutronia: OE-Entities
    * Neutronia: OE-Ocean
    * Neutronia: OE-Wood
    * Neutronia: OE-Items
* Neutronia: End Expansion (WIP)
    * Neutronia: EE-General
    * Neutronia: EE-Items
    * Neutronia: EE-Entities
* Neutronia: Nether Expansion (WIP)
    * Neutronia: NE-General
    * Neutronia: NE-Items
    * Neutronia: NE-Entities
* Neutronia: Planet Expansion (WIP)
    * Neutronia: PE-Moon
    * Neutronia: PE-Mars
    * Neutronia: PE-Sun
